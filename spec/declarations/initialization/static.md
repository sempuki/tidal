# Initialization of static and thread storage

When variables with static or thread storage get their initial values:
which initialization happens before the program runs, which happens at run
time, and in what order. Rules are prefixed `SINIT`.

Depends on: [declarators](../declarators.md), [storage duration](../storage-linkage.md),
[value category](../../glossary.md#value-category), conversions *(referenced)*,
classes *(referenced)*, [constant evaluation](../../glossary.md#constant-evaluation).

Inputs: clang-sema-init, gcc-cp-typeck2, gcc-cp-init, edg-decl-inits,
clang-diag-sema (see `inputs/MANIFEST.md`).
